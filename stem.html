	<title>Thirdlove founder: Heidi Zak</title>
<h1>A Bra revolution</h1>
<p>Twelve. That’s how many bras were in Co-Founder Heidi Zak’s drawer in 2012. How many of them fit? Zero. Frustrated by lousy bras and bad fits, Heidi decided to build her own damn bra. She teamed up with experienced bra designer Ra’el Cohen, who created innovative designs based on breast size and shape. Together, they launched ThirdLove’s first bra—and a small revolution—in 2013.🕷</p>
<h2>Their community</h2>
<p>Every woman deserves to feel comfortable and confident. That core belief drives our company, from the products we design to how we give back. That's why we've partnered with renowned organizations such as I Support the Girls, Soles4Souls, Good360, and St. Anthony’s to donate bras to help women make powerful life changes. To date, we have donated over $20M in bras.😁</p></head>
